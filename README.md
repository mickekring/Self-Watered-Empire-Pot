# Self Watered Empire Pot
What is this? Well, it's a simple project for me to learn more about electronics but mostly about learning Python3. So the basics is; to design and 3D-print all parts, which will be a pot, a speaker, a water tank and some kind of housing for the Raspberry Pi. After that, I'll attach a couple of sensors measuring soil moisture, temperature, humidity and a couple of more things hopefully. We'll see what I can come up with.<br />
When the soil moisture levels are below a certain number a water pump will pump water into the pot.<br />
So why "empire"? Well, I wanted to throw a bit of Star Wars at it. :)

## Work in progress
This project is a work in progress. Check updates for more information.

## Where I'm at - at the moment
Here you'll find a short movie of the latest state of the project.

## Updates
__29 dec 2017 - Initial upload__
Today is the day when I decided to start this GitHub project. More info will be added, and most importantly, this is a work in progress.

## Hardware
Here I'll post the hardware that I'm using and where I bought it. Mostly, it's off Aliexpress, but you can find these generic part pretty much anywhere. I'll add to the list as the project expands.

## 3D models
Here you can find links to the 3D parts that I've designed in TinkerCAD. I'm using an Ultimaker 2 GO, which is a small printer, so these models should easily print on about any machine.
