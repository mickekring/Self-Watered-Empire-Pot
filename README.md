# Self Watering Empire Pot
__What is this? Well, it's a simple DIY/Maker/Python3 project which I created to learn more about electronics but it's mostly about learning Python. So the basics are; to design and 3D-print all parts, which will be a pot, a speaker, a water tank and some kind of housing for the Raspberry Pi. After that, I'll attach a couple of sensors measuring soil moisture, temperature, humidity and a couple of more things hopefully. We'll see what I can come up with.<br />
When the soil moisture levels are below a certain number a water pump will pump water into the pot.<br />
So why "empire"? Well, I wanted to throw a bit of Star Wars at it. :)__

## Work in progress
This project is a work in progress and considered beta at the moment. Check updates for more information.

## Disclaimer
My Python skills are at best on a beginners level so I'll gladly take any good advice.

## Where I'm at - at the moment
Here you'll find short movies of the latest state of the project.<br /><br />

## Road map and goals
This is sort of what I want out of the project. As I get new ideas, this will grow.
- [x] gTTS - Google text to speech - The pot should be able to communicate through speech.
- [x] ~~STT - Speech to text - preferably I'd like to speak to the pot (which is healthy for it as well) as my main input~~ This will not be implemented, since I find it to unreliable and slow. Main means of communication will be trhough Twitter, where I can send commands.
- [x] Temperature sensor - record temperature near the plant for statistics
- [x] Humidity sensor - record humidity near the plant for statistics
- [x] Soil moisture sensor - to sense whether the plant needs water or not
- [ ] Light sensor - record the amount of light the plant gets
- [ ] Proximity sensor - Sense when people are near the plant for automatic status updates
- [x] PWM - Pulse Width Modulation - for a pulsating light effect when red and green alert and for blue when pot is speaking
- [x] Check internet connection and warn if off
- [x] Log sensory inputs in a csv-file
- [x] Send logs to a web server via SFTP and serve graph charts
- [x] Relay - Control water pump
- [ ] Camera - It would be cool if I could hook up a camera and use it to take a snap now and again, which will be sent to a web server
- [x] Design and build casings and pots using 3D-software and printing - I'm designing it by using modules. A pot module, speaker/light module, water tank and so on.
- [x] Design and solder some simple circuit boards - Must learn to solder
- [x] ~~Send warnings and status via e-mail or sms or slack or...~~ It will be communicating via SMS and Twitter.
- [x] Twitter - The pot should be able to tweet. It's twitter account is @empireplantbot
- [x] Fail safes - Make sure that the core functions keeps running and logging is done locally only if eg internet goes down
- [ ] Network messaging - Merge this project with earlier project and make the two RPi's talk to each other
- [x] Glue gun - Glue the s--t out of everything
- [x] Get weather data from openweathermap.org to display and log. Could be interesting to see how much outside temperatures affects the amount of watering needed.
- [ ] Message me when the water tank needs refill. Now, the pump is on for 3 seconds. That's enough for 10 waterings.

## Updates
* __04 jan 2018 - v1.0 - Up and running__</br>
Everyting is running by itself and it responds to tweets, sens SMS if water tank levels are getting low... and most important of all, it waters the plant if the soil is too dry.
* __02 jan 2018 - Added weather data from openweathermap.org__<br/>
Outside temperature, humidity and weather conditions are now a part of the program.
* __01 jan 2018 - SMS and more Twitter__<br />
The program can now accept commands via Twitter, from users who are entrusted. It will be one of the main forms of interactions with the program. It can now send SMS. 
* __29 dec 2017 - Twitter capabilities__<br />
The program is now able to tweet, using Tweepy within Python. A function is setup and it's tweeting whatever is stored in the variable tweetMessage.
* __29 dec 2017 - Initial upload__<br />
Today is the day when I decided to start this GitHub project. More info will be added, but most importantly, this is a work in progress. I've been working on this project for a while, but I thought I ought to document it, so stay tuned.

## 3D models
Here you can find links to the 3D parts that I've designed in TinkerCAD. They are public, so you can grab them and remix them if you like. I'm using an Ultimaker 2 GO, which is a small printer, so these models should easily print on about any machine.

## Python libraries and stuff
In this project I'm using a couple of libraries that you'll probably have to install to run the program. Google how to install these on your system.
* Paramiko - Uploading of files via SFTP to server
* Adafruit_DHT - To make easy use of the DHT11 sensor
* gTTS - Google text to speech
* YAML - To store and retrieve credentials from external yml file
* Tweepy - so that the pot can tweet on Twitter

# Modules
I'll explain what the different modules do here.

## Speaker / Light module
![](https://github.com/mickekring/Self-Watered-Empire-Pot/blob/master/images/speaker_module.jpg "Speaker Module")<br /><br />
The speaker module contains a small speaker and an amplifier (the red little board), with a pot for volume as you can see on the left side of the picture. You can also see the LED diods that I have soldered to a prototype board with resistors. Everything is then glued on.<br />To the right you can see the front, where I've glued on an empire (Star Wars) logo as speaker grille. Above the speaker you see a sort of see through pane which I created (once again) out of glue. This makes the LED lights looking a bit cooler (in my opinion), since you don't really see the individual diods.<br />There's also a separate top and back which will be glued on.

## Pot module
There's not really that much to say about this module, more than that this is where the plant resides.

## History and ideas
![](https://github.com/mickekring/Self-Watered-Empire-Pot/blob/master/images/fortproj2-2.jpg "Sketch")
This is how it all started. With a sketch on my whiteboard at the office. I wanted to learn more about Python3 and what you can do with programming.<br />
More info will be written...
